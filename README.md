# MinecraftTogether

A comprehensive Minecraft server management tool.

## Features
Easy Server Start - *IN DEV*
- Select start a server, select the server, and your done.

Syncing to Remote Repositories - *IN DEV*
- This will allow you to have multiple devices be able to run your server without data loss. For example, if you have a laptop and a desktop, you can decide to run it on either if you don't feel like leaving the other on for an extended period of time.

Easy Server Setup - *PLANNED*
- This will allow you to make any server easily by selecting Minecraft version, forge fabric or vanilla, and the versions of those that you want.

Graphical Interface - *POSSIBILITY*
- Instead of having the plain terminal interface, I could possibly create a nicer looking graphical interface that will be more user friendly and nice to use.
