## Features
Easy Server Start
- Select start a server, select the server, and your done.

Support for Tunneling Software
- Allows you to instantly start tunneling software while using easy server start if you can't port forward. (Built with ngrok and playit.gg in mind)

Syncing to Remote Repositories
- This will allow you to have version control on the cloud for server backups, easy transfer between devices, etc.

Easy Server Setup - *PLANNED*
- This will allow you to make any server easily by selecting Minecraft version, forge fabric or vanilla, and the versions of those that you want.

Graphical Interface - *POSSIBILITY*
- Instead of having the plain terminal interface, I could possibly create a nicer looking graphical interface that will be more user friendly. This seems very far out though if possible.

## Disclaimer
Windows is the targeted operating system for this program, but you could most likely get it to work on Mac or Linux through Wine. Support is coming soon though, the calls that make it windows-only are pretty non-performant, so it will most likely be ready before v1.
