# MinecraftTogether

A comprehensive Minecraft server management tool.

## Features
Easy Server Start
- Select start a server, select the server, and your done.

Syncing to Remote Repositories - *IN DEV*
- This will allow you to have multiple devices be able to run your server without data loss. For example, if you have a laptop and a desktop, you can decide to run it on either if you don't feel like leaving the other on for an extended period of time.

Easy Server Setup - *PLANNED*
- This will allow you to make any server easily by selecting Minecraft version, forge fabric or vanilla, and the versions of those that you want.

Graphical Interface - *POSSIBILITY*
- Instead of having the plain terminal interface, I could possibly create a nicer looking graphical interface that will be more user friendly and nice to use.

## Disclaimer
Windows is the targeted operating system for this program, but you could most likely get it to work on Mac or Linux through Wine. Although it wouldn't be super hard to add support natively, I am more focused on making MinecraftTogether as a whole instead of adding more compatibility. If you want to contribute to the code and fix this issue, figure out how to completely eliminate every system() call and also how to turn it into an AppImage and whatever Mac uses. Thanks!
